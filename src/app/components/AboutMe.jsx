            I am an enthusiastic and versatile software developer who&apos;s
            still learning IT. Passionate about building innovative and
            efficient solutions. I have worked with a variety of technologies.
            <br /> My adventures in software/web development began back in high
            school. We would have exam tests where we had to memorize two whole
            pages of hardcopy code and type it in Notepad++ and sometimes,
            we&apos;d have performance tasks where we had to integrate code
            where we successfully moved a sprite. It was so scary for me that it
            gave me Stockholm syndrome (which is probably the reason why
            I&apos;m pursuing it today ðŸ˜€ðŸ¤™).
            <br /> I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving new
            challenges to deliver high-quality solutions. Outside of
            programming, I LOVE sleeping and playing video games like
            Reverse1999 and Life is Strange series âœ¨.
